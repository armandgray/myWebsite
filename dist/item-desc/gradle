/*======== Introduction ========*/

What is Gradle: Gradle is an open source build automation system for technology in the Java (JVM) world. Gradle adds to Ant and Maven concepts and uses a directed acyclic graph to determine execution order. Gradle provides a Groovy-based domain-specific language and was designed for multi-project scalable builds.

/*======== Getting Started ========*/

INSTALL == with a package manager

SDKMAN!
SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix-based systems.

$ sdk install gradle 3.3
Homebrew
Homebrew is “the missing package manager for macOS”.

$ brew install gradle
Chocolatey
Chocolatey is “the package manager for Windows”.

C:\> choco install gradle

CREATE A PROJECT

gradle init --type=java-library

BUILD PHASES

Initialization
Gradle determines which projects are in the build, and creates a Project instance for each. 
Tasks are created. 
Settings file (usually settings.gradle) is executed. This file determines which projects will be executed in the build. 

Configuration
The build scripts of all projects are executed. 
Configuration on demand: In this mode, Gradle intelligently configures only relevant projects. 
Tasks are configured.
build.gradle:
println 'This is executed during the configuration phase.'

task configured {
    println 'This is also executed during the configuration phase.'
}

task test {
    doLast {
        println 'This is executed during the execution phase.'
    }
}

task testBoth {
    doFirst {
      println 'This is executed first during the execution phase.'
    }
    doLast {
      println 'This is executed last during the execution phase.'
    }
    println 'This is executed during the configuration phase as well.'
}

Execution
Gradle determines the subset of the tasks to be executed. The subset is determined by the task name arguments passed to the gradle command and the current directory.
