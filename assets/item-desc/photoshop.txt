/*======== Where Photoshop Fits In ========*/

Photoshop not only fits into our workflow after we've captured the image. It actually fits into our workflow as we're making the image and we say, hey, I have a vision for something like this. And sometimes the work is really simple and straight forward as we've seen. Other times, maybe it's a bit more involved. Either way, my hope is that by showing you some of these before and afters of my own work, you can start to think about, okay, well these are some of the things that we can do with Photoshop. Now of course this isn't exhaustive.

There are so many things that you can do. And the way that you use Photoshop is completely up to you. That's the fun part. Yet at least we're starting to get a glimpse into how this tool works and what we might do. Well to dig a little bit deeper into how Photoshop fits in, let's get a bit more pragmatic with how we can use this tool.
